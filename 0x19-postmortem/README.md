Issue Summary:
- Duration: The outage occurred from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC+2).
- Impact: The service affected was the banking transaction processing system. Users experienced delays in processing transactions, and approximately 20% of users were affected by the slowdown.
- Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as a database connectivity problem resulting from a network infrastructure misconfiguration.

Timeline:
- 9:00 AM: The issue was detected when an engineer noticed a significant increase in transaction processing time.
- Actions Taken: The database, network, and server components were investigated to identify the cause of the slow transaction processing. Initially, the assumption was made that the issue might be related to high server load.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: The investigation initially focused on server performance optimization, leading to a suboptimal allocation of resources and time.
- Escalation: The incident was escalated to the Database Operations team and the Network Infrastructure team for further investigation and resolution.
- Incident Resolution: The incident was resolved by identifying a misconfiguration in the network infrastructure, specifically a firewall rule that was blocking database connections. Once the misconfiguration was corrected, normal transaction processing was restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause: The issue was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule that was blocking database connections. This misconfiguration prevented the transaction processing system from establishing a connection to the database.
- Resolution: The misconfiguration was identified and rectified by updating the firewall rule to allow proper database connectivity. This ensured that the transaction processing system could establish the necessary connections to the database and resume normal operations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improvements/Fixes: 
  1. Enhance network infrastructure configuration review processes to avoid similar misconfigurations in the future.
  2. Implement regular network infrastructure audits to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations proactively.
  3. Strengthen monitoring capabilities to quickly detect and alert on network connectivity issues.

- Tasks to Address the Issue:
  1. Conduct a thorough review of firewall rules to ensure proper configuration and alignment with the required connectivity.
  2. Develop and implement automated network configuration checks to identify and flag potential misconfigurations.
  3. Establish a proactive monitoring system to detect and alert on any anomalies in database connectivity.

In conclusion, the outage in the banking transaction processing system was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked database connections. The incident was resolved by correcting the misconfiguration. To prevent similar incidents in the future, improvements in network infrastructure configuration, regular audits, and enhanced monitoring capabilities are recommended. Specific tasks, such as reviewing firewall rules and implementing automated checks, should be undertaken to address the issue effectively.
